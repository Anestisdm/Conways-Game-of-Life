# Conway's Game of Life

### 1 - Scope
The purpose of this project is to implement the Conway's Game of Life with Python programming and using a simple graphical interface to represent the game.

### 2 -  Game of Life
Conways’s Game Of Life is a Cellular Automation Method created by John Conway inspired by the biology field. This game is not required user input because is a zero-player game, 
which means that its evolution is determined by its initial state. Τhe Game of Life is built on a board of n x n cells (10 x 10 cells in our case), every cell has eight neighbor cells, as shown in the figure. 
A cell (i, j) in the simulation is accessed on an array[i][j], where i and j are the row and column indices, respectively. 
The value of a given cell at a given instant of time depends on the state of its neighbors at the previous generation. 





Conway’s Game of Life has the following four rules.
